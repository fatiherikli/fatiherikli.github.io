***********************
Statement of Purpose
***********************

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive copyright and related Rights — defined below — upon the creato
r and subsequent owner (each and all) of an original work of author ship
and/or a database (each, a work).

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scien
tific works (commons) that the public can reliably and without fear of l
ater claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other wor
ks, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever 
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. 
These owners may contribute to the commons to promote the ideal of a fre
e culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientifi
c works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expecta
tion of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating
CC0 with a Work (the affirmer), to the extent that ((s)he) is an owner o
f Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply 
CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with k
nowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the 
meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be pro
tected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Re
lated Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limite
d to, the following:

The right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate
and translate a Work. Moral rights retained by the original authors and/
or performers publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's imag
e or likeness depicted/emerged in a work. Rights protecting against unfa
ir competition in regards to a work, subject to the limitations in the p
aragraph below;
